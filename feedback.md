Good job on this project! I really like the interface you created, especially the keyframes! I would make sure to format your code and make sure that you comment your code! See more specific comments inline. I also like how you nested your routes, you can DRY this up by doing so in your `index.js` requirements instead of doing it each time in the methods. Overall really good job on this project!
